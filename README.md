# ðŸ’¯ 100 Days of Verilog â€“ RTL Design Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Verilog** challenge! ðŸš€  
I'm a 3rd-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student, diving deep into the world of Digital Design, RTL Coding, and Hardware Modeling using Verilog HDL.  

This repository is a structured log of my 100-day journey to master Verilog and build a strong foundation for advanced design topics like **SystemVerilog**, **RTL design**, **testbenches**, and eventually landing a **core hardware internship at companies like Intel, NVIDIA, or Qualcomm**.

## ðŸ§­ Roadmap

### Phase 1: Verilog Basics (Day 1-20)
- Digital logic gates, behavioral modeling
- Combinational and Sequential circuits
- `always` blocks, `if-else`, `case`, sensitivity lists

### Phase 2: RTL Design & Practice (Day 21-40)
- Multiplexers, Encoders, Decoders, Adders, Counters
- FSM design (Moore & Mealy)
- Parameterization and Modular Design

### Phase 3: Testbenches & Simulation (Day 41-60)
- Writing Verilog testbenches
- `$monitor`, `$display`, `initial`, `#delay`
- Waveform analysis with GTKWave / ModelSim

### Phase 4: Mini Projects & Problem Solving (Day 61-80)
- Real-world modules: ALU, Serial TX/RX, Clock Divider, Stopwatch, etc.
- Practice problems from [Digital Blocks](https://github.com/ShawonAshraf/digital-blocks) and [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/)

### Phase 5: Transition to SystemVerilog + Resume Projects (Day 81-100)
- Learn SystemVerilog constructs
- Start basic UVM/Testbench flow
- Resume projects for internships
- Begin blogging (optional): Learnings, designs, and tips
